* Variable names should be in `camelCase`
* Classes should be in `PascalCase`
* Constants can be in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
* `any` should be avoided
* Functions, classes and objects should be declared with `const`
* semi-colons on every line even where not needed
* `.property` preferred over `['property']`
* Calls to `super` on first line of `init`
* `global` used sparingly
* Naming
  * Reserved properties are written with `__dunderscores__`, and so should be not used
  * Classes would be in `PascalCase`
  * Functions and classes can be in `snake_case` or `camelCase`, but this should be consistent throughout the codebase
  * Constants should be written in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
